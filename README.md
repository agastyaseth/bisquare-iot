## Bisquare IoT ESP8266 Project
ESP8266 Based IoT Solutions

### Introduction

With the rise in internet-enabled devices in the market, there are only few companies in
India doing R&D and providing end-to-end solutions in the IoT space. Most budget
options are simply Chinese rebranded products, which are, one, unreliable, two, Bisquare
wished to develop their propriety IoT solutions to address this void in the market. The
intent was to create an end-to-end IoT platform, starting from developing their propriety
hardware, based on ESP8266 (shown below) to building a full-stack backend, enabling an
array of services

Several IoT-based solutions using a proprietary ESP8266 based module (as shown below),
and create an IoT platform with an array of services for home automation (with mobile
apps and Voice Control).

Further, the data from the IoT modules would be used for analytics for learning usage
patterns and develop smarter services like suggestive control, ambient temperature based
on local weather etc.

This project lays out the various reference material I found pertinent to the project,
as well as my learnings from my time spent at Bisquare Systems.

### How to run

Use the project report to setup Arduino IDE and setup the flashing environment for ESP8266 and install the dependencies from the library directory.

Next, flash the .ino file to the ESP8266 board through the Arduino IDE and use the document to proceed with initial setup for WiFi connectivity etc.
